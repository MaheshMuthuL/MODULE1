## Date:1/9/25
## Aim:
To write a C++ program that accepts two sequences of character values from the keyboard and displays them on the monitor.

## Algorithm:


Start the program.

Declare two character arrays (strings) to store the input sequences.

Prompt the user to enter the first sequence of characters.

Read the first sequence using cin.

Prompt the user to enter the second sequence of characters.

Read the second sequence using cin.

Display both sequences on the monitor using cout.

End the program.

## Program:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
cout<<"Welcome to Technical Training\n";
cout<<"at Saveetha Engineering College";
return 0;
}







## Output:

## Result:

Thus, the C++ program to read two sequences of character values from the keyboard and display them on the monitor was successfully executed, and the desired output was obtained.
